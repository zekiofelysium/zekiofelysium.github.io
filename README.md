# CaiShan's Note

Welcome to **CaiShan's Note**~!!
This blog aims to record various diaries related to learning lingerie design.
It will record the process of pattern making and sewing learned in class, and I hope to create my own works in the future.

This blog is a webpage built using the [eleventy-classic-blog-starter](https://github.com/TigersWay/eleventy-classic-blog-starter) template and based on the [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) static website generator~!!

The color scheme used on the website is "green" from the "Morandi" color system. The Morandi color system makes people feel warm, relaxed, elegant and comfortable... It is also the favorite color of the moderator, so this is why this website uses this color system.
